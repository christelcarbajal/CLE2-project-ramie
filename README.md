## Setup / Libraries
[_Faker_](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker).
Faker is a library to generate fake data.
I thought this was very interesting and useful to use, 
because it saved me from having to come up with data one by one every time to test my database.


## Project Status
Project is: _completed_ 


## Room for Improvement
There is a lot of room for improvement.
This was my first time designing and coding a website from scratch.
